1. tsc filename.ts // will compile with .ts file
2. tsc filename.ts --watch or -w  // will automatically compile the file
3. 'tsc --init' after that just 'tsc -w' 

// this means that 'tsconfig.json' wil be created and whole project will 
be managed by TS. It will go into watch mode to watch all .ts 
files automatically. Then we configure tsconfig file.
